# KeyFate

> KeyFate is a zero-knowledge dead man's switch service that automatically delivers encrypted secrets to trusted recipients if you become unavailable. Built with Shamir's Secret Sharing and AES-256 client-side encryption.

## Key Facts
- Zero-knowledge architecture — KeyFate cannot read your secrets
- Uses Shamir's Secret Sharing to split secrets into encrypted pieces
- Client-side AES-256 encryption — secrets never leave your device unencrypted
- Check-in based trigger system (daily to yearly intervals)
- Free tier: 1 secret, 1 recipient
- Pro tier: $9/month or $90/year — 10 secrets, 5 recipients each, custom intervals
- Accepts credit card (Stripe) and Bitcoin (BTCPay Server)

## Use Cases
- Cryptocurrency key inheritance
- Digital estate planning
- Journalist source protection
- Password/credential backup for family
- Business continuity planning

## How It Works
1. You create a secret and designate recipients
2. Your secret is split into 3 pieces using Shamir's Secret Sharing (in your browser)
3. You keep 1 piece, your recipient gets 1 piece, KeyFate stores 1 piece (encrypted, unreadable)
4. You check in on your chosen schedule
5. If you miss check-ins, KeyFate releases its piece to your recipient
6. Recipient combines 2 pieces to reconstruct the secret
