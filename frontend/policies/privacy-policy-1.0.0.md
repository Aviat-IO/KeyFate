## 1. Introduction

KeyFate is a secure dead man's switch platform designed with privacy by design
principles. Secret creation and recovery happen 100% client-side using Shamir's
Secret Sharing. We never receive enough information to reconstruct your secrets,
as we only store one encrypted share that alone cannot reveal your sensitive
information.
