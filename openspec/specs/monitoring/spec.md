# monitoring Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change harden-production-security. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Structured Logging with Sanitization

The system SHALL implement structured logging that automatically sanitizes
sensitive data.

#### Scenario: Sensitive data redaction

- **GIVEN** a log entry contains data with sensitive field names
- **WHEN** the log is written
- **THEN** the system SHALL redact fields matching sensitive patterns
  (serverShare, encryptedShare, secret, token, password, key, otp)
- **AND** SHALL replace values with [REDACTED] placeholder
- **AND** SHALL preserve non-sensitive context for debugging

#### Scenario: Structured log format

- **GIVEN** any log event occurs
- **WHEN** the log is written
- **THEN** the system SHALL use JSON format with standard fields (level,
  message, timestamp, requestId)
- **AND** SHALL include sanitized context data
- **AND** SHALL include request metadata (method, path, userId) when available

#### Scenario: Log level configuration

- **GIVEN** the application is running
- **WHEN** logs are written
- **THEN** the system SHALL respect LOG_LEVEL environment variable (debug, info,
  warn, error)
- **AND** SHALL only output logs at or above configured level
- **AND** SHALL default to 'info' level if not specified

#### Scenario: Sensitive data leak prevention

- **GIVEN** an error contains sensitive data in stack trace or message
- **WHEN** the error is logged
- **THEN** the system SHALL scan for sensitive patterns before logging
- **AND** SHALL redact any detected sensitive values
- **AND** SHALL log a warning if sensitive data was found and redacted

### Requirement: APM Integration

The system SHALL integrate with Application Performance Monitoring for error
tracking and alerting.

#### Scenario: Error capture

- **GIVEN** an unhandled exception occurs
- **WHEN** the error is caught by error boundary or handler
- **THEN** the system SHALL send error details to Sentry
- **AND** SHALL include sanitized context (requestId, userId, route)
- **AND** SHALL not include sensitive data (secrets, tokens, shares)

#### Scenario: Error grouping

- **GIVEN** similar errors occur multiple times
- **WHEN** errors are sent to Sentry
- **THEN** Sentry SHALL group errors by stack trace fingerprint
- **AND** SHALL deduplicate identical errors
- **AND** SHALL track error frequency over time

#### Scenario: Critical error alerting

- **GIVEN** error rate exceeds threshold
- **WHEN** more than 10 errors per hour occur
- **THEN** Sentry SHALL send alert to on-call team
- **AND** SHALL include error details and affected users
- **AND** SHALL deliver alert within 5 minutes of threshold breach

#### Scenario: Performance monitoring

- **GIVEN** the application handles requests
- **WHEN** performance data is collected
- **THEN** Sentry SHALL track response times (p50, p95, p99)
- **AND** SHALL identify slow database queries
- **AND** SHALL alert if p95 exceeds 500ms

### Requirement: Request ID Tracing

The system SHALL assign unique request IDs for distributed tracing and log
correlation.

#### Scenario: Request ID generation

- **GIVEN** a new HTTP request is received
- **WHEN** the request enters the system
- **THEN** the system SHALL generate a unique request ID (UUID v4)
- **AND** SHALL attach the ID to the request context
- **AND** SHALL include the ID in the response headers (X-Request-ID)

#### Scenario: Request ID propagation

- **GIVEN** a request has an assigned request ID
- **WHEN** the request makes internal calls (database, external APIs)
- **THEN** the system SHALL include the request ID in all log entries
- **AND** SHALL pass the request ID to downstream services
- **AND** SHALL enable end-to-end request tracing

#### Scenario: Request ID correlation

- **GIVEN** an error occurs during request processing
- **WHEN** investigating the error
- **THEN** the operator SHALL be able to search logs by request ID
- **AND** SHALL see all log entries related to that request
- **AND** SHALL trace the request flow across components

### Requirement: Security Event Logging

The system SHALL log security-relevant events for audit and incident response.

#### Scenario: Authentication events

- **GIVEN** authentication events occur
- **WHEN** user logs in, fails login, or locks out
- **THEN** the system SHALL log the event with timestamp, userId, email, IP
  address, and outcome
- **AND** SHALL log rate limit violations
- **AND** SHALL log OTP generation and validation attempts

#### Scenario: Authorization events

- **GIVEN** authorization checks occur
- **WHEN** access is granted or denied
- **THEN** the system SHALL log the event with userId, resource, action, and
  outcome
- **AND** SHALL log CSRF validation failures
- **AND** SHALL log email verification enforcement

#### Scenario: Administrative actions

- **GIVEN** administrative actions occur
- **WHEN** admin endpoints are accessed
- **THEN** the system SHALL log the action with admin token hash, IP address,
  and action details
- **AND** SHALL log all secret access and modifications
- **AND** SHALL maintain audit trail for Pro users indefinitely

#### Scenario: Security anomalies

- **GIVEN** anomalous security events occur
- **WHEN** webhook replay detected, cron authentication fails, or unusual access
  patterns emerge
- **THEN** the system SHALL log the anomaly with full context
- **AND** SHALL send alert if severity is high
- **AND** SHALL enable incident response investigation

### Requirement: Centralized Configuration

The system SHALL centralize tier limits and security configuration for
consistency.

#### Scenario: Single source of truth for tier limits

- **GIVEN** tier limits are referenced throughout the codebase
- **WHEN** code checks tier limits (max secrets, max recipients, max shares)
- **THEN** the system SHALL reference centralized configuration constant
- **AND** SHALL not duplicate limit values in multiple files
- **AND** SHALL enable easy updates to tier limits

#### Scenario: Security configuration centralization

- **GIVEN** security thresholds are configured
- **WHEN** rate limits, timeouts, or retry logic is needed
- **THEN** the system SHALL reference centralized security config
- **AND** SHALL support environment-specific overrides (dev vs prod)
- **AND** SHALL validate configuration at startup
