# Security Testing Specification

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Automated Security Scanning in CI/CD

The system SHALL perform automated security vulnerability scanning using OWASP
ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy) on every pull request and staging deployment to detect
common web application security vulnerabilities before production deployment.

#### Scenario: Pull request triggers baseline security scan

- **GIVEN** a developer creates a pull request to the main or staging branch
- **WHEN** the GitHub Actions workflow is triggered
- **THEN** OWASP ZAP baseline scan (passive) SHALL execute against the staging
  environment
- **AND** the scan SHALL complete within 10 minutes
- **AND** the scan results SHALL be uploaded as a GitHub Actions artifact
- **AND** high-severity findings SHALL fail the PR status check
- **AND** medium and low-severity findings SHALL be reported but not block the
  PR

#### Scenario: Staging deployment triggers full security scan

- **GIVEN** code is deployed to the staging environment
- **WHEN** the deployment completes successfully
- **THEN** OWASP ZAP full scan (active) SHALL execute against staging
- **AND** the scan SHALL test for OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
- **AND** the scan results SHALL be available as downloadable artifacts
- **AND** high-severity findings SHALL trigger a notification
- **AND** the scan SHALL complete within 60 minutes

#### Scenario: Security scan detects CSRF vulnerability

- **GIVEN** an endpoint lacks CSRF protection
- **WHEN** ZAP scans the application
- **THEN** a high-severity CSRF finding SHALL be reported
- **AND** the finding SHALL include the vulnerable endpoint URL
- **AND** the finding SHALL include remediation guidance
- **AND** the PR status check SHALL fail

### Requirement: ZAP Scan Configuration

The system SHALL support customizable ZAP scan rules to suppress false positives
and configure scan behavior appropriate for the application architecture.

#### Scenario: Configure custom scan rules

- **GIVEN** a `.zap/rules.tsv` configuration file exists
- **WHEN** ZAP scan executes
- **THEN** the scan SHALL apply the custom rules
- **AND** suppressed findings SHALL not appear in reports
- **AND** scan thresholds SHALL match configured severity levels

#### Scenario: False positive suppression

- **GIVEN** a known false positive finding (e.g., CSP warning on development
  endpoints)
- **WHEN** the finding is added to `.zap/rules.tsv` as IGNORE
- **THEN** subsequent scans SHALL not report this finding
- **AND** the suppression SHALL be documented with a reason

### Requirement: Security Scan Reporting

The system SHALL generate comprehensive security scan reports in both
human-readable (HTML) and machine-readable (JSON) formats for analysis and
auditing.

#### Scenario: Generate HTML security report

- **GIVEN** a ZAP scan completes
- **WHEN** the workflow finishes
- **THEN** an HTML report SHALL be generated
- **AND** the report SHALL include all findings categorized by severity
- **AND** the report SHALL include vulnerability descriptions and remediation
  steps
- **AND** the report SHALL be downloadable from GitHub Actions artifacts

#### Scenario: Generate JSON report for automation

- **GIVEN** a ZAP scan completes
- **WHEN** the workflow processes results
- **THEN** a JSON report SHALL be generated
- **AND** the JSON SHALL include structured finding data
- **AND** the JSON SHALL be parseable for automated analysis
- **AND** the JSON SHALL include timestamps and scan metadata

### Requirement: Scan Result Validation

The system SHALL validate scan results against security baselines and fail
builds when high-severity vulnerabilities are detected.

#### Scenario: High-severity finding fails PR

- **GIVEN** ZAP detects a high-severity vulnerability (e.g., SQL injection)
- **WHEN** the scan completes
- **THEN** the GitHub status check SHALL fail
- **AND** the PR SHALL be blocked from merging
- **AND** the failure message SHALL reference the security report
- **AND** the finding details SHALL be visible in the workflow logs

#### Scenario: Medium-severity findings are informational

- **GIVEN** ZAP detects medium-severity findings
- **WHEN** the scan completes
- **THEN** the GitHub status check SHALL pass
- **AND** the findings SHALL be visible in the report
- **AND** a warning comment MAY be added to the PR

#### Scenario: Zero findings allows PR merge

- **GIVEN** ZAP detects no vulnerabilities
- **WHEN** the baseline scan completes
- **THEN** the GitHub status check SHALL pass
- **AND** the PR SHALL be eligible for merging
- **AND** the scan results SHALL confirm "no high-severity findings"

### Requirement: Scan Performance

ZAP scans SHALL complete within acceptable time limits to avoid blocking
development workflows.

#### Scenario: Baseline scan completes quickly

- **GIVEN** a baseline scan is triggered on a PR
- **WHEN** the scan executes
- **THEN** the scan SHALL complete within 10 minutes
- **AND** the workflow SHALL not timeout
- **AND** developers SHALL receive timely feedback

#### Scenario: Full scan runs asynchronously

- **GIVEN** a full scan is triggered on staging deployment
- **WHEN** the scan executes
- **THEN** the scan SHALL run asynchronously (not blocking deployment)
- **AND** the scan SHALL complete within 60 minutes
- **AND** results SHALL be available after completion
