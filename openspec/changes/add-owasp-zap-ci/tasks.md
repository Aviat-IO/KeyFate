# Implementation Tasks

## 1. ZAP Configuration

- [ ] 1.1 Create `.zap/` directory for configuration files
- [ ] 1.2 Create `.zap/rules.tsv` for scan customization (ignore false
      positives)
- [ ] 1.3 Document expected ZAP findings based on current security hardening

## 2. GitHub Actions Workflow

- [ ] 2.1 Create `.github/workflows/security-scan.yml`
- [ ] 2.2 Configure baseline scan trigger (on pull_request to main/staging)
- [ ] 2.3 Configure full scan trigger (on push to staging)
- [ ] 2.4 Add ZAP Docker container setup
- [ ] 2.5 Configure scan target URLs (use staging environment)
- [ ] 2.6 Set up artifact upload for ZAP reports
- [ ] 2.7 Configure GitHub status checks for security scan

## 3. Scan Types Implementation

- [ ] 3.1 Implement baseline scan (passive, quick, ~5 minutes)
- [ ] 3.2 Implement full scan (active, thorough, ~30-60 minutes)
- [ ] 3.3 Configure scan rules and severity thresholds
- [ ] 3.4 Set up failure conditions (high-severity findings fail the build)

## 4. Reporting & Artifacts

- [ ] 4.1 Configure HTML report generation
- [ ] 4.2 Configure JSON report for machine parsing
- [ ] 4.3 Upload reports as GitHub Actions artifacts
- [ ] 4.4 Add scan summary to PR comments (optional)

## 5. Documentation

- [ ] 5.1 Document how to view ZAP reports
- [ ] 5.2 Document common findings and remediation steps
- [ ] 5.3 Document how to suppress false positives
- [ ] 5.4 Add security scanning to deployment checklist

## 6. Testing & Validation

- [ ] 6.1 Test baseline scan on sample PR
- [ ] 6.2 Test full scan on staging deployment
- [ ] 6.3 Verify ZAP reports are generated correctly
- [ ] 6.4 Verify scan failures block PR merges appropriately
- [ ] 6.5 Test false positive suppression rules
- [ ] 6.6 Validate scan performance (runtime acceptable)
