CREATE TABLE data_export_jobs (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  status TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'processing', 'completed', 'failed')),
  file_url TEXT,
  file_size BIGINT,
  download_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  expires_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  completed_at TIMESTAMP,
  error_message TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE account_deletion_requests (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  status TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'confirmed', 'cancelled', 'completed')),
  confirmation_token TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  confirmation_sent_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  confirmed_at TIMESTAMP,
  scheduled_deletion_at TIMESTAMP,
  cancelled_at TIMESTAMP,
  deleted_at TIMESTAMP,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_export_jobs_user_status ON data_export_jobs(user_id, status);
CREATE INDEX idx_deletion_requests_user_status ON account_deletion_requests(user_id, status);
CREATE INDEX idx_deletion_requests_scheduled ON account_deletion_requests(scheduled_deletion_at)
  WHERE status = 'confirmed' AND deleted_at IS NULL;
```
