# Authentication Security Hardening

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Strong OTP Generation

The system SHALL generate 8-digit one-time passwords with cryptographically
secure randomness for email-based authentication.

#### Scenario: OTP code generation

- **GIVEN** a user requests authentication
- **WHEN** the system generates an OTP
- **THEN** the code SHALL be exactly 8 numeric digits (00000000-99999999)
- **AND** SHALL be generated using cryptographically secure random number
  generation
- **AND** SHALL have a uniform distribution across all possible values

#### Scenario: OTP expiration

- **GIVEN** an OTP has been generated
- **WHEN** 5 minutes have elapsed since generation
- **THEN** the OTP SHALL be marked as expired
- **AND** SHALL not be accepted for authentication
- **AND** the user SHALL be required to request a new OTP

### Requirement: OTP Rate Limiting

The system SHALL implement per-email rate limiting to prevent brute-force
attacks on OTP codes.

#### Scenario: Per-email validation rate limit

- **GIVEN** a user attempts OTP validation
- **WHEN** more than 5 validation attempts occur for the same email within 15
  minutes
- **THEN** the system SHALL reject subsequent attempts with 429 status
- **AND** SHALL include a Retry-After header indicating when attempts can resume
- **AND** SHALL log the rate limit violation for security monitoring

#### Scenario: Account lockout after repeated failures

- **GIVEN** a user has failed OTP validation
- **WHEN** more than 10 failed attempts occur for the same email within 1 hour
- **THEN** the system SHALL lock the account
- **AND** SHALL require manual support intervention to unlock
- **AND** SHALL send an alert to security monitoring
- **AND** SHALL notify the account owner via email

#### Scenario: Rate limit reset

- **GIVEN** a user has been rate limited
- **WHEN** the rate limit window expires (15 minutes for validation, 1 hour for
  lockout)
- **THEN** the system SHALL reset the attempt counter
- **AND** SHALL allow new authentication attempts

### Requirement: Email Verification Enforcement

The system SHALL enforce email verification for all operations involving secret
management.

#### Scenario: Unverified user attempts secret creation

- **GIVEN** a user has not verified their email address
- **WHEN** the user attempts to create a secret
- **THEN** the system SHALL reject the request with 403 status
- **AND** SHALL return a clear error message indicating email verification
  required
- **AND** SHALL provide a link to resend verification email

#### Scenario: Unverified user attempts check-in

- **GIVEN** a user has not verified their email address
- **WHEN** the user attempts to perform a check-in
- **THEN** the system SHALL reject the request with 403 status
- **AND** SHALL return a clear error message indicating email verification
  required

#### Scenario: Verified user access

- **GIVEN** a user has verified their email address
- **WHEN** the user attempts any secret-related operation
- **THEN** the system SHALL allow the operation to proceed
- **AND** SHALL not prompt for additional verification

### Requirement: Session Idle Timeout

The system SHALL implement idle timeout for user sessions to limit exposure of
stolen session tokens.

#### Scenario: Active session tracking

- **GIVEN** a user has an active session
- **WHEN** the user performs any authenticated action
- **THEN** the system SHALL update the last activity timestamp
- **AND** SHALL extend the session validity

#### Scenario: Idle session expiration

- **GIVEN** a user session has been idle
- **WHEN** 24 hours have elapsed since last activity
- **THEN** the system SHALL expire the session
- **AND** SHALL require re-authentication
- **AND** SHALL redirect to login page with clear timeout message

#### Scenario: Session activity window

- **GIVEN** a user has an active session
- **WHEN** the user performs actions within 24-hour windows
- **THEN** the session SHALL remain valid
- **AND** SHALL not expire prematurely

### Requirement: Sensitive Operation Re-authentication

The system SHALL require additional authentication for high-risk operations even
within an active session.

#### Scenario: Server share reveal requires re-auth

- **GIVEN** a user has an active session
- **WHEN** the user attempts to reveal a server share
- **THEN** the system SHALL prompt for OTP re-entry
- **AND** SHALL require valid OTP verification before revealing share
- **AND** SHALL expire the re-authentication prompt after 5 minutes

#### Scenario: Account deletion requires re-auth

- **GIVEN** a user has an active session
- **WHEN** the user attempts to delete their account
- **THEN** the system SHALL prompt for OTP re-entry
- **AND** SHALL require valid OTP verification before proceeding
- **AND** SHALL log the deletion attempt with authentication details

## MODIFIED Requirements

None - All authentication requirements are new additions to harden existing
implementation.

## REMOVED Requirements

None - Existing authentication behavior preserved, only security enhancements
added.
