# Infrastructure Security & Reliability

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Startup Environment Validation

traffic.

- **AND** SHALL exit with error message indicating correct key length
  requirement

#### Scenario: Invalid authentication secrets

- **GIVEN** NEXTAUTH_SECRET, CRON_SECRET, or ADMIN_TOKEN is less than 32
  characters
- **WHEN** the application starts
- **THEN** the system SHALL fail validation
- **AND** SHALL exit with error indicating minimum length requirement

#### Scenario: Invalid database connection string

- **GIVEN** DATABASE_URL is not a valid PostgreSQL connection string
- **WHEN** the application starts
- **THEN** the system SHALL fail validation
- **AND** SHALL exit with error indicating correct format

### Requirement: Database Connection Pooling

The system SHALL manage database connections with explicit pool configuration
and retry logic.

#### Scenario: Connection pool configuration

- **GIVEN** the application connects to the database
- **WHEN** the connection pool is initialized
- **THEN** the system SHALL set max connections to 10 for development, 20 for
  production
- **AND** SHALL set connection timeout to 5 seconds
- **AND** SHALL set idle timeout to 30 seconds
- **AND** SHALL enable connection keep-alive

#### Scenario: Connection retry with exponential backoff

- **GIVEN** a database connection attempt fails
- **WHEN** the failure is transient (network error, connection refused)
- **THEN** the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s)
- **AND** SHALL log each retry attempt
- **AND** SHALL fail after 5 retry attempts with clear error message

#### Scenario: Connection pool exhaustion

- **GIVEN** all connections in the pool are in use
- **WHEN** a new request requires a database connection
- **THEN** the system SHALL wait up to 5 seconds for an available connection
- **AND** SHALL return 503 status if no connection becomes available
- **AND** SHALL log connection pool exhaustion event

### Requirement: Enhanced Health Checks

The system SHALL provide comprehensive health checks for all critical
subsystems.

#### Scenario: Database connectivity check

- **GIVEN** a health check request is received
- **WHEN** the system queries database connectivity
- **THEN** the system SHALL execute a simple query (SELECT 1)
- **AND** SHALL return success if query completes within 2 seconds
- **AND** SHALL return failure with error details if query fails or times out

#### Scenario: Email service validation

- **GIVEN** a health check request is received
- **WHEN** the system validates email service
- **THEN** the system SHALL verify SMTP credentials are configured
- **AND** SHALL optionally test connection to SMTP server (configurable)
- **AND** SHALL return success if email service is available

#### Scenario: Encryption key validation

- **GIVEN** a health check request is received
- **WHEN** the system validates encryption configuration
- **THEN** the system SHALL verify ENCRYPTION_KEY is set and correct length
- **AND** SHALL perform a test encryption/decryption cycle
- **AND** SHALL return success if encryption operations work correctly

#### Scenario: Readiness vs liveness

- **GIVEN** the system provides both readiness and liveness endpoints
- **WHEN** /api/health/live is called
- **THEN** the system SHALL return success if the application process is running
- **WHEN** /api/health/ready is called
- **THEN** the system SHALL return success only if all subsystems (database,
  email, encryption) are operational

### Requirement: Automated Database Backups

The system SHALL implement and verify automated database backup procedures.

#### Scenario: Daily backup execution

- **GIVEN** the backup system is configured
- **WHEN** the scheduled backup time occurs (daily at 2 AM UTC)
- **THEN** the system SHALL trigger Cloud SQL automated backup
- **AND** SHALL verify backup completion
- **AND** SHALL log backup success or failure
- **AND** SHALL alert on-call team if backup fails

#### Scenario: Backup retention policy

- **GIVEN** automated backups are running
- **WHEN** backups accumulate over time
- **THEN** the system SHALL retain daily backups for 30 days
- **AND** SHALL retain weekly backups for 90 days
- **AND** SHALL automatically delete backups older than retention period

#### Scenario: Backup restore testing

- **GIVEN** a backup exists
- **WHEN** restore testing is performed (monthly)
- **THEN** the system SHALL restore to a test environment
- **AND** SHALL verify data integrity post-restore
- **AND** SHALL document restore time and any issues
- **AND** SHALL alert if restore fails or takes longer than 4 hours (RTO)

### Requirement: Database Schema Management

The system SHALL manage schema changes with validated migration and rollback
procedures.

#### Scenario: Migration execution

- **GIVEN** a new database migration is ready to deploy
- **WHEN** the migration is applied
- **THEN** the system SHALL execute migration within a transaction
- **AND** SHALL record migration version in schema tracking table
- **AND** SHALL rollback transaction if any step fails

#### Scenario: Migration validation

- **GIVEN** a migration is being prepared
- **WHEN** migration validation runs
- **THEN** the system SHALL test migration on staging environment
- **AND** SHALL verify rollback procedure works
- **AND** SHALL document migration and rollback steps
- **AND** SHALL require approval before production deployment

#### Scenario: Rollback execution

- **GIVEN** a migration has been applied and issues are detected
- **WHEN** rollback is initiated
- **THEN** the system SHALL execute documented rollback steps
- **AND** SHALL restore database to pre-migration state
- **AND** SHALL verify data integrity post-rollback
- **AND** SHALL log rollback execution and results
