# Remediate OWASP ZAP Security Findings

## Why

OWASP ZAP security scan identified 10 categories of vulnerabilities with 161
total instances across the application. The findings include missing security
headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, HSTS), information disclosure through suspicious
comments and server headers, and potential clickjacking vulnerabilities. These
issues violate security best practices and expose the application to various
attack vectors including XSS, clickjacking, cache poisoning, and information
leakage.

## What Changes

### High Priority (5 findings)

- **Content Security Policy (CSP) Header Not Set (11 instances)**: Implement CSP
  header to prevent XSS attacks
- **Missing Anti-clickjacking Header (10 instances)**: Add X-Frame-Options or
  CSP frame-ancestors to prevent clickjacking
- **Strict-Transport-Security Header Not Set (41 instances)**: Add HSTS header
  to enforce HTTPS connections
- **X-Content-Type-Options Header Missing (41 instances)**: Add
  X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff to prevent MIME-type sniffing
- **Server Leaks Information via "X-Powered-By" HTTP Response Header Field (10
  instances)**: Remove X-Powered-By header to prevent technology stack
  disclosure

### Medium Priority (4 findings)

- **Information Disclosure - Suspicious Comments (9 instances)**: Remove or
  sanitize suspicious comments from HTML/JS responses
- **Modern Web Application (5 instances)**: Informational - acknowledge modern
  JS framework usage
- **Re-examine Cache-control Directives (5 instances)**: Review and optimize
  cache-control headers for security
- **Retrieved from Cache (46 instances)**: Informational - verify cache behavior
  is intentional

### Low Priority (1 finding)

- **User Agent Fuzzer (12 instances)**: Informational - application handles
  various user agents correctly

## Impact

- **Affected specs**: http-security (new capability)
- **Affected code**:
  - `frontend/next.config.ts` - Add security headers configuration
  - `frontend/src/middleware.ts` - Implement CSP and security headers middleware
  - `frontend/src/app/layout.tsx` - Add CSP meta tags if needed
  - Frontend source files - Remove suspicious comments
  - `.github/workflows/test.yml` - Add comment linting to CI
- **No breaking changes**: Security headers are additive and should not affect
  existing functionality
- **Performance impact**: Minimal - headers add ~200-500 bytes per response
- **Browser compatibility**: Modern browsers (IE11+ for most headers, all modern
  browsers for CSP Level 2)
